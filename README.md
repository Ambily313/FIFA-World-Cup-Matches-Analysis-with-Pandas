# 🏆 FIFA World Cup Matches Analysis with Pandas

A data analysis project focused on exploring FIFA World Cup match data from 1930 to 2022 using Pandas. This includes time series exploration, groupby aggregation, pivot tables, custom insights, and visualizations to derive meaningful football analytics.

- **Dataset**: [FIFA World Cup Matches (1930–2022](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martj42/international_results/master/results.csv))
This dataset contains information about all FIFA World Cup matches: scores, teams, dates, stadiums, and more — great for time series, grouping, and categorical analysis.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Solved 50 Pandas practice questions across time series, grouping, and match analytics.
- Extracted trends by year/month, counted matches, and created pivot tables.
- Analyzed team performance: wins, goal differences, draws, and head-to-head results.
- Built visualizations (line plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, box plots).
- Created custom columns (winner, match result, blowouts) and saved outputs to files..
